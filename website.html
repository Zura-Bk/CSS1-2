                <h2 id="h2">THE MAGIC OF GLOWING CREATURES</h2>
                <p id="biolum">Did you know some animals and plants can glow in the dark? This cool trick is called bioluminescence. It happens when a special chemical reaction inside their bodies creates light. It’s like nature’s version of neon lights!</p>
                <h3>Here’s how it works:</h3>
                <div class="list2">
                    <div class="list3">
                        <ol id="list4">
                            <li>A molecule called luciferin mixes with oxygen.</li>
                            <li>An enzyme called luciferase helps speed up the process.</li>
                            <li>Voilà! A glow appears, but without heat – it’s called “cold light.”</li>
                        </ol>
